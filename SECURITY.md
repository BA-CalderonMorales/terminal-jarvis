# Security Policy

## Overview

Terminal Jarvis is a CLI tool that manages AI coding assistants. We take security seriously and follow responsible disclosure practices.

## IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE

**AI-Scanned Repository Warning**: This repository is regularly scanned by AI tools for security analysis. While these scans help maintain security standards, AI can hallucinate or miss certain vulnerabilities.

**RECOMMENDED SECURITY PRACTICES:**

### For All Users
**Use Remote Development Environments**

We **strongly recommend** using Terminal Jarvis in isolated environments:

- **GitHub Codespaces** (preferred by maintainers)
- **Docker containers** with appropriate security controls
- **Virtual machines** isolated from your main system
- **Cloud development environments** (AWS Cloud9, GitPod, etc.)

### Why Remote Development?

1. **Isolation**: Protects your main system from potential undiscovered vulnerabilities
2. **Containment**: Limits blast radius if security issues are found
3. **Best Practice**: Industry standard for testing CLI tools that execute external commands
4. **Maintainer Practice**: Our team uses GitHub Codespaces for all Terminal Jarvis testing

### Maintainer Security Practices

**How We Test Terminal Jarvis:**
- All maintainer testing occurs in **GitHub Codespaces**
- No direct installation on personal/production machines
- Containerized testing environments for all AI CLI interactions
- Regular security audits using isolated environments

**What This Means for You:**
- Follow the same isolation practices we use
- Don't install directly on your primary development machine
- Use containers or remote environments for testing
- Treat Terminal Jarvis like any external CLI tool requiring isolation

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.0.57  | Current stable   |
| 0.0.55-0.0.56| Previous stable |
| < 0.0.55| No longer supported |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Reporting Process

1. **Do NOT create a public issue** for security vulnerabilities.
2. **Reach out to the Maintainers**: We're pretty responsive and will rectify ASAP. 
3. **Include the following information:**
   - Description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce.
   - Potential impact assessment.
   - Your contact information.

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 1-2 weeks (hobby project timeline)
- **Severity Assessment**: Within 2-3 weeks
- **Fix Development**: Varies by complexity and maintainer availability
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released (coordinated disclosure)

### Severity Levels

**Critical**: Remote code execution, privilege escalation
- Response: Best effort within 1-2 weeks
- Fix: Emergency release when maintainer time permits

**High**: Authentication bypass, data exposure
- Response: Within 2-3 weeks
- Fix: Priority release (2-6 weeks depending on complexity)

**Medium**: Limited scope vulnerabilities
- Response: Within 1 month
- Fix: Next scheduled release

**Low**: Minor security improvements
- Response: When maintainer availability allows
- Fix: Future release (no timeline guarantee)

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

- **Memory Safety**: Written in Rust, preventing buffer overflows
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated through type-safe parsing
- **Process Isolation**: External tools run in separate processes
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Zero embedded credentials or API keys
- **Controlled Command Execution**: Limited to predefined tool mappings

### Security Architecture

- **Command Injection Protection**: Arguments passed safely to subprocess execution
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: File operations limited to controlled directories
- **Environment Isolation**: Temporary environment modifications with restoration
- **Dependency Security**: Regular updates and vulnerability monitoring

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation Security

1. **Use Package Managers**: Install via NPM, Cargo, or Homebrew
2. **Verify Signatures**: Check package integrity when possible
3. **Isolated Testing**: Always test in containers or remote environments
4. **Monitor Dependencies**: Keep Terminal Jarvis updated

### Runtime Security

1. **Limited Permissions**: Don't run with elevated privileges
2. **Network Monitoring**: Be aware of network connections made by AI tools
3. **Temporary Files**: Ensure proper cleanup of temporary directories
4. **Configuration Security**: Protect your AI tool configurations and API keys

### Development Security

1. **Code Review**: Review any custom configurations or extensions
2. **Dependency Auditing**: Regularly audit Terminal Jarvis dependencies
3. **Access Controls**: Limit who can modify Terminal Jarvis configurations
4. **Logging**: Monitor Terminal Jarvis usage in production environments

## Known Security Considerations

### AI Tool Integration Risks

- **Network Connections**: AI tools may connect to external services
- **Data Transmission**: Code/text may be sent to AI providers
- **Authentication**: AI tools require API keys or authentication
- **Privacy**: Consider data privacy implications of AI tool usage

### Mitigation Strategies

- **API Key Management**: Use environment variables, not hardcoded keys
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitor outbound connections from AI tools
- **Data Classification**: Consider what code/data you share with AI tools
- **Audit Logging**: Track Terminal Jarvis and AI tool usage

## Security Updates

### Notification Channels

- **GitHub Releases**: Security updates announced in release notes
- **Security Advisories**: Critical issues published as GitHub Security Advisories
- **CHANGELOG.md**: All security fixes documented

### Update Recommendations

- **Automatic Updates**: Consider enabling automatic updates for patch releases
- **Regular Reviews**: Check for updates monthly
- **Testing**: Test updates in isolated environments first
- **Rollback Plans**: Maintain ability to rollback if issues occur

## Security Contact

For security-related questions or concerns that don't rise to the level of vulnerabilities:

- **GitHub Discussions**: Use for general security questions
- **Issues**: For non-sensitive security improvements
- **Email**: [maintainer email] for confidential security discussions

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the security research community and responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. Contributors who report valid security issues will be credited in our security advisories (with their permission).
